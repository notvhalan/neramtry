    <p>
      We believe that investment strategies, like companies, must grow and evolve with the market. 
      Our core technology-driven strategies include:

  <!-- Strategies List Section -->
  <section class="strategies-list">
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2>[01] Public</h2>
      <p>
        We established our public equity strategy with the firm's launch in 1999. Our focus is on disciplined, 
        long-term investing across the most exciting mega-trends in technology. We aim to identify these trends 
        at a global level and back the biggest beneficiaries as the market develops and matures.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2>[02] Growth</h2>
      <p>
        We expanded our reach to Silicon Valley in 2013 in order to launch our growth investing business. 
        Consistent with our public strategy, our aim is to identify generational, technology-focused leaders 
        that are building world-shaping companies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2>[03] Venture</h2>
      <p>
        The insights gained from the success of our growth business allowed us to build out our presence in private 
        markets in 2018 with a dedicated team focused on early-stage investing. Our focus for ventures is on big ideas 
        and visionary technology founders at the earliest stages of seed and Series A.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2>[04] Thematic</h2>
      <p>
        We have developed deep expertise across several themes such as climate technology and fintech that we believe 
        will disrupt traditional sectors, create new use cases, and fuel increased adoption over the next decade.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2>[05] Structured Capital</h2>
      <p>
        We seek to create value for investors in all market conditions. Our bespoke approach to structured capital allows 
        us to provide companies and founders with tactical solutions that are tailored to their unique financing needs, 
        even in challenging markets.

  <!-- Forecasting Section -->
  <section class="forecasting">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Forecasting in a Connected World</h2>
      <p>
        Commodities have undergone an information revolution. From ship tracking to oil storage levels and crop yields, 
        more data on supply, demand, storage, and transport is available than ever before. Commodity markets are more globally 
        connected: natural gas markets impact fertilizer production, agricultural markets impact gasoline production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding these dynamics with the goal of delivering consistent investment returns presents a set of incredible opportunities 
        and complex challenges. We bring together exceptional people to do just that. We combine specialist domain expertise with advanced 
        modeling techniques to solve problems that others deem unsolvable.

  <!-- Specialized Approach Section -->
  <section class="specialized-approach">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>A Specialized, Integrated Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We emphasize depth over breadth of understanding, modeling markets at the deepest level of granularity. Using a large and growing 
        array of diverse data sources, we run these models in a fast and flexible manner against thousands of assumptions and scenarios 
        to explore our investment hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our investment technology underpins every aspect of our process. Our engineers drive the ingestion of data, the distributed computation 
        of our scenarios, and our trade execution algorithms. Many are embedded within our investment teams and focus on specific product types. 
        Others provide robust environments and tooling for our global strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teamâ€™s culture emphasizes collaboration, rigor, and debate. Some of our hardest problems span multiple commodities and geographies. 
        We collaborate across investment teams to solve them together. In turn, we make better-informed decisions.
