      <h2>Forecasting in a Connected World</h2>
      <p>
        Commodities have undergone an information revolution. From ship tracking to oil storage levels and crop yields, 
        more data on supply, demand, storage, and transport is available than ever before. Commodity markets are more globally 
        connected: natural gas markets impact fertilizer production, agricultural markets impact gasoline production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding these dynamics with the goal of delivering consistent investment returns presents a set of incredible opportunities 
        and complex challenges. We bring together exceptional people to do just that. We combine specialist domain expertise with advanced 
        modeling techniques to solve problems that others deem unsolvable.

      <h2>A Specialized, Integrated Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We emphasize depth over breadth of understanding, modeling markets at the deepest level of granularity. Using a large and growing 
        array of diverse data sources, we run these models in a fast and flexible manner against thousands of assumptions and scenarios 
        to explore our investment hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our investment technology underpins every aspect of our process. Our engineers drive the ingestion of data, the distributed computation 
        of our scenarios, and our trade execution algorithms. Many are embedded within our investment teams and focus on specific product types. 
        Others provide robust environments and tooling for our global strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teamâ€™s culture emphasizes collaboration, rigor, and debate. Some of our hardest problems span multiple commodities and geographies. 
        We collaborate across investment teams to solve them together. In turn, we make better-informed decisions.
