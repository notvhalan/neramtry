# Stage 1: Build dependencies
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy only package.json and package-lock.json to leverage Docker's layer caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Create lightweight production image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy built application and dependencies from the build stage
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app /usr/src/app

# Expose the port your application will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Specify environment variables (optional: safer to pass during container run or via orchestrators like Kubernetes)
# ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "./bin/www"]
