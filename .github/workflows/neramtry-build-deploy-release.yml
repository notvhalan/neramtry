name: Deploy infrastructure and relase node js application
##Â Here is an example snippet which you can use to deploy your infrastructure to Azure

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Change this to any other branch you wish to deploy to

jobs:
  infrastructure: # You can change this name to anything else you wish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This could also be a windows machine e.g windows-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # This will obtain all the code for you in your repository

      - name: Setup Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} # Ensure you create a AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret object in your Github secrets and variables

      - name: Deploy or update infrastructure
        uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
        with:
          subscriptionId: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }} # If you have multiple subscriptions this will switch to the correct subscription for you
          resourceGroupName: ${{ vars.NODEJS_RG }} # This doesn't have to be a variable, you could also hard code this, but ensure you create a variable if you use this approach
          template: ./devops/dev/main.dev.bicep # This is an assumed directory structure ensure you change to the correct directory as well as rename environment to uat or prod etc
          parameters: ./devops/dev/main.dev.bicepparam
